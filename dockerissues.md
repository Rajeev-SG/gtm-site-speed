Here is a summary of the issues we've troubleshooted:

1. The Initial npm run build Failure (A Cryptic Syntax Error)
Symptom: The first build failed during the npm run build step with a SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list.
Diagnosis: This error occurred inside a file generated by Next.js. Such errors are rarely an issue with your actual source code. Instead, they are classic symptoms of the build environment being too constrained.
Root Cause:
Memory: The Node.js process running the build likely ran out of memory and crashed, leaving behind a corrupted or incomplete file that the JavaScript parser couldn't read.
Missing Libraries: The initial node:20-slim base image is minimal and can sometimes lack system libraries that complex build tools (like Next.js's bundler) depend on, leading to unexpected failures.
2. The apt-get GPG Signature Errors
Symptom: After we switched to a more complete node:20-bullseye image to solve the first problem, the build started failing at the apt-get update step with GPG error: ... is not signed.
Diagnosis: This error means the package manager inside the container could not verify the authenticity of the Debian software repositories.
Root Cause: This is almost always caused by one of two things:
The GPG keys inside the base Docker image are outdated. (We tried to fix this by moving to the even newer bookworm image, but the error persisted).
(Most Likely Cause) A network proxy, corporate firewall, or a corrupted local Docker cache on your machine was interfering with or blocking the GPG key validation process. The fact that the error occurred across multiple base images and even when using Google's official repository strongly points to an external, environmental issue.
Solution: We were forced to implement a workaround by adding trusted=yes to the repository configurations inside the Dockerfile. This tells the package manager to bypass the GPG signature check, which is not ideal for security but is a necessary step in restrictive network environments.
3. The Return of the npm run build Failure
Symptom: After successfully installing all system dependencies (including Chrome), the build once again failed with the exact same SyntaxError as the very first attempt.
Diagnosis: This is the key insight. Since the system environment was now correctly set up, the return of this error points directly back to the suspected network instability.
Root Cause: The same network interference that blocked GPG validation was almost certainly corrupting the npm package downloads during the npm ci step. When packages are downloaded incompletely or with errors, you end up with broken files in your node_modules directory. When the Next.js build process tries to parse or bundle these corrupted files, it fails with a SyntaxError. We attempted to mitigate this by force-cleaning the npm cache, but the root cause of the corruption (the network environment) remained.
Summary
The journey has been a classic case of peeling back layers of an onion. We started with a build-process error, which led us to discover a system-level package installation error, which in turn pointed to a fundamental issue with the local build environment's network access. This environmental issue was the root cause of both the apt-get failures and the npm build failures, which is why the problem seemed to reappear after being "fixed".
